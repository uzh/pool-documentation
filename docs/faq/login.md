# Registration and Login

## Error message

When signing up to the pool with an e-mail address already in use or resetting the password of an inexistant address, the response will always be a success message to hide the information about existing accounts from unauthorized persons.

## Paused accounts

Paused contacts can still log in but they won't be invited to new experiments anymore.
