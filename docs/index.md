# Z Pool Tool Documentation

**The "Z-Pool-Tool" project aims to create an integral technical platform for all existing and future subject Pools for the DIZH universities. The "Z-Pool-Tool" should enable a technologically uniform, operationally independent recruitment of test persons as well as the administration of test person pools for all organizational units of the DIZH universities.**

Users of the "Z-Pool-Tool" are therefore institutes and other DIZH organizational units that want to set up subject pools for specific purposes and maintain them according to their individual needs. The pools themselves are then available to researchers according to the specifications of the individual pools. In addition, a new DIZH volunteer pool of several 10,000 people is to be established as a strategic resource for the search for volunteers for online and offline research, independent of commercial service providers.
